So far, I'm only looking for `java` and `javac`, but there are plenty of other executables associated with the jre and jdk.
Additionally, I'm only peeking at OpenJDK stuff that I have installed at the moment, this could be much more widely scouted.

There are a bunch of other executables under `/usr/lib/jvm/java-<version>-openjdk-amd64/bin`.
